# EthanSpaceInvaders
My version of Space Invaders. Game made with Python and pygame library. This is one my first completed side projects. This features what I have learned so far about programming. I use OOP and its fundamentals, loops, functions, ect.. and I learned fundamental game design such as collision, game over, and handling framerate.
My favorite part of the project was making a (hard-coded) level creator that allows me to create levels within minutes.
