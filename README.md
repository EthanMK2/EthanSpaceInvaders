# EthanSpaceInvaders
My own twist on Space Invaders. Game made with Python and pygame library. This is my first completed side project of my career! This features what I have learned so far about programming. I use OOP and its fundamentals, loops, functions, ect.. and I leared fundamental game design such as collision, game over, and handling framerate.
To play:
You can simply download the executable and install the game anywhere on your system and run the main.py file. If you somehow have all the dependencies, python installed, and have pycharm open, you could load the necessary files found here into a pycharm directory and run it in that IDE.
