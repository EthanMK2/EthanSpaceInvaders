# EthanSpaceInvaders
My own twist on Space Invaders. Game made with Python and pygame library. This is my first completed side project of my career! This features what I have learned so far about programming. I use OOP and its fundamentals, loops, functions, ect.. and I leared fundamental game design such as collision, game over, and handling framerate.
